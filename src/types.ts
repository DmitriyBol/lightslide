/**
 * Main carousel props. Generic over the slide `data` shape `T` (carried through to the
 * analytics payloads), defaulting to `unknown`. Write `<LightSlide<Product> …>` to type the
 * whole chain; omit it and everything still works with an unspecified data type.
 *
 * - `label` — accessible name for the carousel region. When set, the container is a labelled
 *   `region` landmark (else a plain `group`); either way it is announced as a carousel.
 * - `slideLabel` — formats each slide's automatic accessible name (default
 *   `${index + 1} of ${count}`); a per-slide `aria-label` on `<Slide>` overrides it.
 * - `gap` — horizontal space between adjacent slides, px (default 0). Applied as CSS
 *   `column-gap` on the track and folded into all geometry: slide width, snap positions,
 *   the fractional flush of the last slide, loop clones, and flow.
 * - `align` — where the active slide rests in the viewport (default `'start'`, the left
 *   edge). `'center'` centres it, with the neighbours peeking symmetrically — the hero /
 *   stories pattern; pair it with a fractional `slidesPerView` (e.g. 1.2), since with
 *   exactly one slide per view there is nothing to centre against and the prop is a no-op.
 *   Without `isLoop` the track never scrolls past its edges (no blank space): the first and
 *   last positions rest flush against them, so only looping keeps every slide perfectly
 *   centred. Ignored while `flow` runs — continuous motion has no resting position.
 * - `breakpoints` — responsive overrides: each key is a media query, its value replaces
 *   `slidesPerView`/`gap` while the query matches, e.g.
 *   `{'(min-width: 768px)': {slidesPerView: 2}, '(min-width: 1200px)': {slidesPerView: 3}}`.
 *   When several queries match, later entries win per property, so ordering them
 *   mobile-first behaves like CSS. The server (and any client without `matchMedia`) renders
 *   with the base props; matches apply on hydration.
 * - `initialIndex` — starting position (0..maxIndex, clamped). Uncontrolled: the carousel owns
 *   the index afterwards — read changes via `onIndexChange`, drive them via `index`/the ref.
 * - `index` — controlled position: whenever the value changes, the carousel animates to it. It
 *   does not lock the carousel — gestures and buttons still navigate; pair with
 *   `onIndexChange` to keep your state in sync. Ignored while `flow` runs.
 * - `onIndexChange` — fires after every settled position change, from any source: drag,
 *   buttons, pagination, auto-scroll, or the external API.
 * - `navigation` / `pagination` / `flow` / `wheel` / `free` / `a11y` — the opt-in plugin
 *   slots. Each takes the node(s) from its tree-shakeable entry (`lightslide/navigation`,
 *   `lightslide/pagination`, `lightslide/flow`, `lightslide/wheel`, `lightslide/free`,
 *   `lightslide/a11y`), e.g. `navigation={<Navigation />}` or `flow={<Flow speed={60} />}`.
 *   Omit a slot and none of that entry's code or styles enters your bundle. Flow supersedes
 *   autoScroll and forces looping on while it runs. Wheel turns horizontal trackpad/wheel
 *   gestures into page turns (drift during flow) without touching vertical page scrolling.
 *   Free replaces the drag-to-snap gesture with momentum scrolling (`<FreeScroll />` rests
 *   anywhere, `<FreeScroll snap />` lands on a boundary); flow, when running, still owns the
 *   track.
 * - `lazyMount` — defer mounting far-away slides: `true` or `{margin}` renders slides
 *   outside the visible window (± `margin` slides, default 1) as empty shells. The shell is
 *   the consumer's own slide element with all its props — size, class, style, ARIA — so
 *   geometry, snap, and loop stay exact and mounting causes no layout shift; only the
 *   children (images, embeds, heavy cards) wait for the window to approach. Loop clones
 *   follow their original slide. Ignored while `flow` runs (continuous motion has no
 *   resting window — every slide mounts). Give slides an explicit height when the height
 *   would come from lazy content, and keep using native `loading="lazy"` for plain images —
 *   this defers React subtrees, not image bytes.
 * - `loading` — when true, the carousel renders `fallback` instead of the slides — useful
 *   while async slide data is still being fetched. With no `fallback` it renders nothing.
 * - `fallback` — node rendered in place of the track while `loading` is true (your own
 *   skeleton / spinner / placeholder).
